ðŸ¥‡ I'm a computer science enthusiast learning development of Internet Scale Serverless Applications using JAM stack and MERN stack. I'm further working on adding PWA functionality to these applications and RESTful APIs which will support these applications. I've experince in ReactJs, MaterialUI, Typescript, Javascript, consuming APIs in ReactJs applications, C++, C, Python, PWAs and GraphQL. I'm further extending my knowledge to developing DApps: merging Blockchain with these applications.
